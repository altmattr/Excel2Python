We must have used some European software to generate this because it seems to have a centi-seconds data separated with a comma?  We don't have the tooling to deal with timport his, and we are not even confident that is what it is, and who needs that sort of precision?  Imagine our job is to \"clean up\" that data so the centi-seconds are not there."
